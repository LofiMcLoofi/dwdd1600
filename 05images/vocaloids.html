        <h1>Vocaloids</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Fanbase and Character Interpretation</h2>
            <p>
                The Vocaloid fanbase plays a major role in shaping how Vocaloid characters are perceived.
                While each Vocaloid has an official visual design, they do not have fixed personalities.
                Instead, fans and music producers assign traits, emotions, and roles to these characters
                through songs, animations, artwork, and storytelling. As popular songs circulate online,
                the personalities associated with a Vocaloid spread throughout the community, even though
                the character's appearance and model remain unchanged.
            </p>
            <p>
                This shared interpretation allows a single Vocaloid character to represent many different
                emotions and narratives. Over time, repeated themes in music and fan works lead to commonly
                recognized personality traits, such as Hatsune Miku being seen as cheerful or Kagamine Rin
                and Len being portrayed with contrasting temperaments. These traits are not officially
                defined but become widely accepted through collective fan participation, demonstrating how
                the Vocaloid community shapes character identity without altering the original character
                designs.
